# Fuzzy Matching System

This document describes the fuzzy matching system for bibliographic items, designed to efficiently find similar entries in large bibliographies (100,000+ items).

## Overview

The fuzzy matching system consists of two main components:

1. **Comparator**: Detailed scoring functions that compare individual BibItems
2. **Fuzzy Matcher**: High-performance search using blocking indexes to reduce the search space

## Architecture

### Design Principles

- **No data loss**: Blocking strategy suggests candidates but never excludes potential matches
- **Performance first**: Multi-index blocking reduces 100k items to 500-2000 candidates before scoring
- **Transparency**: Every match includes detailed score breakdown for manual review
- **Robustness**: Handles dirty real-world data (missing fields, date gaps, garbage characters)

### Performance Characteristics

- **Index building**: 1-2 minutes for 100,000 items (one-time cost)
- **Single query**: 0.5-2 seconds average
- **Batch processing**: 1000 queries in 8-30 minutes
- **Memory**: Immutable structures, generators for one-time iteration

## Comparator Module

Location: `philoch_bib_sdk/logic/functions/comparator.py`

### Legacy Function: `compare_bibitems()`

Original comparison function that returns a simple aggregated score.

**Signature:**
```python
def compare_bibitems(
    reference: BibItem,
    subject: BibItem,
    bibstring_type: TBibString
) -> ScoredBibItems
```

**Returns:**
```python
{
    "reference": BibItem,
    "subject": BibItem,
    "score": {
        "score": int,          # Total score
        "score_title": int,    # Title component
        "score_author": int,   # Author component
        "score_year": int      # Year component
    }
}
```

### Enhanced Function: `compare_bibitems_detailed()`

New comparison function with detailed scoring breakdown and configurable weights.

**Signature:**
```python
def compare_bibitems_detailed(
    reference: BibItem,
    subject: BibItem,
    bibstring_type: TBibString = "simplified",
    weights: tuple[float, float, float, float] = (0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1),
) -> Tuple[PartialScore, ...]
```

**Parameters:**
- `reference`: The reference BibItem to compare against
- `subject`: The subject BibItem being compared
- `bibstring_type`: Which text variant to use (`"simplified"`, `"latex"`, or `"unicode"`)
- `weights`: Weights for (title, author, date, bonus) components - must sum to 1.0

**Returns:**
Tuple of four `PartialScore` objects, one for each component:
- Title score
- Author score
- Date score
- Bonus fields score (DOI, journal+volume+number, pages, publisher)

### PartialScore Structure

```python
@attrs.define(frozen=True, slots=True)
class PartialScore:
    component: ScoreComponent      # TITLE, AUTHOR, DATE, etc.
    score: int                     # Raw score before weighting
    weight: float                  # Weight applied (0.0-1.0)
    weighted_score: float          # Final score (score * weight)
    details: str                   # Human-readable explanation
```

### Scoring Components

#### Title Scoring

**Base scoring:**
- Uses fuzzy string matching (Levenshtein distance via rapidfuzz)
- Normalizes text: lowercase, remove extra whitespace
- Base fuzzy score: 0-100

**Bonuses:**
- High similarity (>85%) OR one title contained in other: +100
- Applies only if no undesired keyword mismatch

**Penalties:**
- Undesired keyword mismatch (e.g., "errata" vs no "errata"): -50 per keyword

**Undesired keywords:**
- `"errata"`
- `"review"`

**Default weight:** 50% (0.5)

#### Author Scoring

**Base scoring:**
- Formats full author names using `format_author()`
- Uses fuzzy string matching on formatted names
- Removes extra whitespace
- Base fuzzy score: 0-100

**Bonuses:**
- High similarity (>85%): +100

**Default weight:** 30% (0.3)

#### Date Scoring

**Flexible matching strategy:**

1. **Missing dates**: Returns 0 (no penalty, but no score)

2. **Exact match**: 100 points
   ```python
   year_1 == year_2
   ```

3. **Close years** (±1 to ±3 years): Partial credit for reprints/editions
   ```python
   year_diff = 1 → score = 90
   year_diff = 2 → score = 80
   year_diff = 3 → score = 70
   ```

4. **Same decade**: 30 points
   ```python
   year_1 // 10 == year_2 // 10
   ```

5. **Different decades**: 0 points

**Rationale:**
- Handles reprints (e.g., 1950 original, 1953 reprint)
- Handles editions (e.g., 2001 first edition, 2003 second edition)
- Robust to 50+ year gaps for classical works

**Default weight:** 10% (0.1)

#### Bonus Fields Scoring

Combines multiple secondary signals:

**DOI exact match**: +100 points (highest confidence)

**Journal + Volume + Number match**: +50 points
- All three must match exactly
- Journal names compared after normalization (lowercase, whitespace removal)

**Pages match**: +20 points
- Compares page start numbers
- Exact match required

**Publisher match**: +10 points
- Fuzzy matching on normalized publisher names
- Requires similarity >85%

**Default weight:** 10% (0.1)

### Score Calculation

Total weighted score for a match:
```python
total_score = (
    title_score * 0.5 +
    author_score * 0.3 +
    date_score * 0.1 +
    bonus_score * 0.1
)
```

**Typical score ranges:**
- Exact match (same item): 400-500
- Very good match (likely duplicate): 300-400
- Good match (possible duplicate): 200-300
- Weak match (manual review needed): 100-200
- Poor match (likely different): <100

### Core Functions

#### `build_index()`

Builds a multi-index structure for fast candidate retrieval.

**Signature:**
```python
def build_index(bibitems: Sequence[BibItem]) -> BibItemBlockIndex
```

**Index Structure:**

1. **DOI Index** - Exact lookup
   ```python
   doi_index: dict[str, BibItem]
   ```

2. **Title Trigrams** - Fuzzy title matching
   ```python
   title_trigrams: dict[str, FrozenSet[BibItem]]
   ```
   - Extracts 3-character n-grams from normalized titles
   - Example: "The Republic" → {"the", "he ", "e r", " re", "rep", ...}

3. **Author Surnames** - Author matching
   ```python
   author_surnames: dict[str, FrozenSet[BibItem]]
   ```
   - Extracts normalized family names from all authors

4. **Year Decades** - Temporal filtering
   ```python
   year_decades: dict[int | None, FrozenSet[BibItem]]
   ```
   - Groups items by decade (1990, 2000, 2010, etc.)
   - `None` key for items with missing dates

5. **Journal Names** - Journal-based filtering
   ```python
   journals: dict[str, FrozenSet[BibItem]]
   ```
   - Normalized journal names as keys

6. **All Items** - Fallback
   ```python
   all_items: Tuple[BibItem, ...]
   ```
   - Complete dataset for cases where no candidates found

**Time complexity:** O(n) where n is number of items
**Space complexity:** O(n × k) where k is average number of trigrams/surnames per item

#### `find_similar_bibitems()`

Finds the top N most similar BibItems using blocking strategy and detailed scoring.

**Signature:**
```python
def find_similar_bibitems(
    subject: BibItem,
    index: BibItemBlockIndex,
    top_n: int = 5,
    min_score: float = 0.0,
    bibstring_type: TBibString = "simplified",
) -> Tuple[Match, ...]
```

**Parameters:**
- `subject`: BibItem to find matches for
- `index`: Pre-built index from `build_index()`
- `top_n`: Number of top matches to return
- `min_score`: Minimum score threshold (filters low-quality matches)
- `bibstring_type`: Text variant to use for comparison

**Returns:**
Tuple of `Match` objects, sorted by score (descending), ranked 1 to N.

**Algorithm:**

1. **Check DOI** - If subject has DOI and it exists in index, return instantly
2. **Extract title trigrams** - Get all 3-grams from subject title
3. **Lookup trigrams** - Union all items that share any trigram
4. **Extract author surnames** - Get family names from subject authors
5. **Lookup surnames** - Union all items that share any surname
6. **Extract year decade** - Get decade bucket for subject
7. **Lookup decades** - Union items from ±5 decades (±50 years)
8. **Extract journal** - Get normalized journal name if present
9. **Lookup journal** - Union all items from same journal
10. **Combine candidates** - Union of all above lookups
11. **Score candidates** - Use `compare_bibitems_detailed()` on each candidate
12. **Calculate totals** - Sum weighted scores for each candidate
13. **Filter by threshold** - Remove candidates below `min_score`
14. **Select top N** - Use `cytoolz.topk()` for efficient heap-based selection
15. **Create Match objects** - Format results with rank

**Time complexity:** O(c × log(c)) where c is number of candidates (typically 500-2000)
**Space complexity:** O(c)

#### `stage_bibitem()`

Stages a single BibItem with timing metadata.

**Signature:**
```python
def stage_bibitem(
    bibitem: BibItem,
    index: BibItemBlockIndex,
    top_n: int = 5,
    min_score: float = 0.0,
) -> BibItemStaged
```

**Returns:**
```python
BibItemStaged(
    bibitem=bibitem,
    top_matches=tuple[Match, ...],
    search_metadata={
        "search_time_ms": int,      # Milliseconds elapsed
        "candidates_searched": int   # Number of candidates scored
    }
)
```

#### `stage_bibitems_batch()`

Processes multiple BibItems in batch.

**Signature:**
```python
def stage_bibitems_batch(
    bibitems: Sequence[BibItem],
    index: BibItemBlockIndex,
    top_n: int = 5,
    min_score: float = 0.0,
) -> Tuple[BibItemStaged, ...]
```

**Usage pattern:**
```python
# Build index once
index = build_index(bibliography)

# Process thousands of new items
staged = stage_bibitems_batch(new_items, index, top_n=5)

# Each staged item has top 5 matches with full score details
```

## Data Models

Location: `philoch_bib_sdk/logic/models_staging.py`

### ScoreComponent

Enum defining score types:
```python
class ScoreComponent(StrEnum):
    TITLE = "title"
    AUTHOR = "author"
    DATE = "date"
    DOI = "doi"
    JOURNAL_VOLUME_NUMBER = "journal_volume_number"
    PAGES = "pages"
    PUBLISHER = "publisher"
```

### Match

A single match result with full details:

```python
@attrs.define(frozen=True, slots=True)
class Match:
    bibkey: str                           # Formatted bibliography key
    matched_bibitem: BibItem              # Full matched item
    total_score: float                    # Sum of weighted scores
    partial_scores: Tuple[PartialScore, ...]  # Detailed breakdown
    rank: int                             # Position in results (1-based)

    def to_json_summary(self) -> dict[str, object]:
        """Convert to JSON-serializable dict for CSV export."""
```

### BibItemStaged

Wrapper for a BibItem with its matches:

```python
@attrs.define(frozen=True, slots=True)
class BibItemStaged:
    bibitem: BibItem                    # The item being matched
    top_matches: Tuple[Match, ...]      # Top N matches found
    search_metadata: dict[str, int]     # Performance metrics

    def to_csv_row(self) -> dict[str, str | int | float]:
        """Convert to flat CSV row with JSON-encoded matches."""
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Fuzzy Matching

```python
from philoch_bib_sdk.logic.functions.fuzzy_matcher import (
    build_index,
    find_similar_bibitems,
)

# Load your bibliography
bibliography = load_bibliography()  # Tuple[BibItem, ...]

# Build index (one-time, ~1-2 min for 100k items)
index = build_index(bibliography)

# Find matches for a new item
new_item = parse_bibitem(dirty_data)
matches = find_similar_bibitems(new_item, index, top_n=5, min_score=100.0)

# Review matches
for match in matches:
    print(f"Rank {match.rank}: {match.bibkey}")
    print(f"Total score: {match.total_score:.2f}")
    print(f"Title: {match.matched_bibitem.title.simplified}")

    # Detailed score breakdown
    for ps in match.partial_scores:
        print(f"  {ps.component}: {ps.weighted_score:.2f} ({ps.details})")
```

### Batch Processing with CSV Export

```python
from philoch_bib_sdk.logic.functions.fuzzy_matcher import (
    build_index,
    stage_bibitems_batch,
)
import csv

# Build index from existing bibliography
index = build_index(existing_bibliography)

# Process new items in batch
new_items = load_new_items()  # From external source
staged = stage_bibitems_batch(new_items, index, top_n=5, min_score=100.0)

# Export to CSV for manual review
with open('matches_report.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:
    if staged:
        fieldnames = staged[0].to_csv_row().keys()
        writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=fieldnames)
        writer.writeheader()
        writer.writerows(item.to_csv_row() for item in staged)

# CSV columns:
# - staged_bibkey: Key of new item
# - staged_title: Title of new item
# - staged_author: Author(s) of new item
# - staged_year: Year of new item
# - num_matches: How many matches found
# - best_match_score: Score of top match
# - best_match_bibkey: Key of top match
# - top_matches_json: Full details in JSON format
# - search_time_ms: Performance metric
# - candidates_searched: Number of items scored
```

### Custom Scoring Weights

```python
from philoch_bib_sdk.logic.functions.comparator import compare_bibitems_detailed

# Prioritize author matching over title
custom_weights = (0.3, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1)  # (title, author, date, bonus)

partial_scores = compare_bibitems_detailed(
    reference=existing_item,
    subject=new_item,
    bibstring_type="simplified",
    weights=custom_weights
)

total = sum(ps.weighted_score for ps in partial_scores)
```

### Handling Dirty Data

The system is designed to handle:

**Missing fields:**
```python
# Item with no date
item_no_date = default_bib_item(
    title={"simplified": "Article Title"},
    # date defaults to "no date"
)
# Still matches based on title and author
```

**Date gaps (reprints, editions):**
```python
# Original 1950, reprint 2020
# Still matches due to flexible date scoring and title/author match
```

**Garbage characters:**
```python
# "**Article Title" vs "Article Title"
# Trigram overlap still captures match
```

**Incomplete data:**
```python
# Only family name, no given name
# Still indexed by surname trigrams
```

## Performance Tuning

### Index Building

For very large bibliographies (>100k items):

1. **Memory**: Index size is approximately 5-10x the input data size
2. **Time**: Linear in number of items and average field lengths
3. **Optimization**: Build index once, reuse for all queries

### Query Performance

Factors affecting query speed:

1. **Candidate set size**: More candidates = slower
   - Typical: 500-2000 candidates per query
   - Worst case: All items (when no index hits)

2. **Fuzzy scoring**: Dominant cost is string comparison
   - Title fuzzy matching: O(m × n) where m, n are string lengths
   - Author fuzzy matching: Similar complexity

3. **Top-N selection**: Uses heap-based selection O(c log N)
   - c = number of candidates
   - N = top_n parameter

### Optimization Strategies

**Reduce candidate set:**
- Ensure items have good metadata (titles, authors, dates)
- More metadata = better index hit rates

**Adjust thresholds:**
- Higher `min_score` = fewer results, faster
- Lower `min_score` = more results, slower

**Batch processing:**
- Use `stage_bibitems_batch()` instead of loop with `stage_bibitem()`
- Generator-based, better memory efficiency

**Pre-filtering:**
- If you know constraints (e.g., only items from last 10 years), filter input before building index

## Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **No multiprocessing**: Sequential processing per query
   - Could parallelize batch processing across CPU cores if needed

2. **In-memory index**: Entire index held in memory
   - Not suitable for billions of items without external storage

3. **String-based matching only**: No semantic understanding
   - "car" and "automobile" scored as different
   - No synonym handling

4. **Language-agnostic**: No language-specific fuzzy matching
   - Works on normalized strings regardless of language

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements if needed:

1. **Parallel batch processing**: Use multiprocessing for 10× speedup
2. **Persistent index**: Store index on disk for very large datasets
3. **Semantic matching**: Use embeddings for semantic similarity
4. **Phonetic matching**: For author name variations
5. **Abbreviation handling**: Match "J." to "John" in author names

## Troubleshooting

### No matches found

**Possible causes:**
- Subject item has minimal metadata (no title, author, or date)
- Bibliography items have incompatible metadata
- `min_score` threshold too high

**Solutions:**
- Lower `min_score` to 0.0 to see all candidates
- Check that subject item has populated fields
- Verify index was built correctly

### Too many low-quality matches

**Possible causes:**
- Subject item has very generic title/author
- `min_score` threshold too low

**Solutions:**
- Increase `min_score` threshold (try 200-300)
- Reduce `top_n` to fewer results
- Add additional filtering based on entry type or journal

### Slow performance

**Possible causes:**
- Very large candidate set (>10k items)
- Subject item matches too many trigrams

**Solutions:**
- Increase index granularity (longer trigrams)
- Add pre-filtering before staging
- Consider batch processing with multiprocessing

### Memory issues

**Possible causes:**
- Bibliography too large (>1M items)
- Index contains too many duplicates

**Solutions:**
- Deduplicate bibliography before indexing
- Consider external index storage
- Process in batches with smaller sub-indexes

## Testing
